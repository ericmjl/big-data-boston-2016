# about myself

- doctoral candidate, MIT biological engineering
- self-taught pythonista
- using networks to problems in infectious disease ecology, evolution & biochemistry

# outline

1. what are networks?
1. example 1: recommendation systems
1. example 2: panama papers
1. example 3: influenza ecology & evolution
1. example 4: neural networks on networks

# what are networks

networks, a.k.a. **graphs**, are composed of **nodes** (circles) and **edges** (lines)

![a simple network.](./figures/networks.png){#networks .class width=400}

# example 1: recommendation systems

if `A` is connected to `B` and `C`, but `B` and `C` are not connected, then maybe they should be!

![a simple recommendation system.](./figures/recommender.png){#recommender .class width=200}

# example 1: recommendation systems

if `A` and `B` share overlapping interests, then maybe some of `B`'s interests can be recommended to `A`.

# example 2: panama papers

graph databases were used to show how the rich hide their money.[^money]

# example 3: influenza ecology and evolution

![for influenza, gene shuffling probably helps in host switching.](./figures/influenza.png){#flu .class width=400}

# example 4: neural networks on networks

# conclusions

- think relationally
- networks can be used creatively to solve all sorts of problems
