# about myself

- doctoral candidate, MIT biological engineering
- self-taught pythonista
- using networks to problems in infectious disease ecology, evolution & biochemistry

# outline

1. what are networks?
1. example 1: recommendation systems - cliques
1. example 2: panama papers - path tracing
1. example 3: influenza ecology & evolution - network statistics
1. example 4: neural networks on networks - graph deep learning

# what are networks

networks, a.k.a. **graphs**, are composed of **nodes** (circles) and **edges** (lines)

# example 1: recommendation systems

if `A` is connected to `B` and `C`, but `B` and `C` are not connected, then maybe they should be!

# example 2: influenza ecology and evolution

# example 3: neural networks on networks

# conclusions

- think relationally
- networks can be used creatively to solve all sorts of problems
